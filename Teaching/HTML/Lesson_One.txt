Introduction to HTML
What is HTML?
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. Unlike Python, which is a programming language, HTML is a markup language that structures the content of a webpage.

Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Every HTML document has a basic structure consisting of several key elements. Here's a simple example:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Let's break this down:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.

<html>: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title.

<title>: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.

<body>: Contains the content of the webpage that is visible to users.

<h1>: A heading element. <h1> is the largest heading, and <h6> is the smallest.

<p>: A paragraph element for adding text.

HTML Tags and Attributes
Tags
HTML is made up of tags that define elements. Each tag is enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <tagname>. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag <tagname> and a closing tag </tagname>.

Attributes
Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are included inside the opening tag and are always written in the form of name-value pairs, e.g., <tagname attribute="value">.

Example:

html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
Here, src is the attribute that specifies the path to the image, and alt provides alternative text if the image cannot be displayed.

Common HTML Elements
Headings
HTML provides six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>. Example:

html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
Paragraphs
Paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag. Example:

html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Links
Links are created using the <a> tag. Example:

html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
Images
Images are added using the <img> tag. Example:

html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
Lists
There are two types of lists in HTML:

Ordered lists: <ol>

Unordered lists: <ul>

Example:

html
<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ul>
HTML vs. Python
Syntax: HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets, while Python uses indentation and colons.

Purpose: HTML structures content, while Python performs logical operations.

Case Sensitivity: HTML is not case-sensitive, while Python is.
