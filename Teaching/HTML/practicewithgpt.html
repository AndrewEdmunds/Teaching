                We all have our preferences, but some lines should not be crossed. Lillia is a unique character in 
                League of Legends, and this page is dedicated to explaining why she should be appreciated for her design and gameplay,
                rather than being overly sexualized.

            <h3>Why Lillia Should Not Be Sexualized:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>She is a hybrid creature (half-deer, half-human).</li>
                <li>Her design is meant to be whimsical and mystical, not seductive.</li>
                <li>She embodies a dreamlike fantasy, not a romantic figure.</li>
                <li>She is a fierce warrior, not a stereotypical love interest.</li>
            </ul>
