# Now that you understand the basics of control flow with if, elif, and else statements, now we move onto loops!

# Loops
# Loops are essential in programming. They help us automate repetitive tasks and iterate over sequences. 
# We'll start with the basic types of loops in Python: `for` and `while`.

# For Loops
# A `for` loop is used for iterating or "going over" a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). 

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# In this code block, the `for` loop will print each fruit in the `fruits` list.

# Try it yourself!
# Create a list of your favorite anything.
# Write a `for` loop to print each items name:







# While Loops
# A `while` loop will continue to execute as long as its condition remains true.

i = 1

while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1



# This loop will print numbers 1 to 5. The loop will stop when `i` becomes 6.

# Exercise:
# Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 to 1:







# Break and Continue
# Sometimes you need more control over your loops. This is where `break` and `continue` come in.
# `break` will stop the loop entirely.
# `continue` will skip the current iteration and continue with the next one.

# Example with `break`:

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# This will print numbers 1 to 4 and then stop.

# Example with `continue`:

for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        continue
    print(i)

# This will print numbers 1 to 4 and 6 to 9, skipping 5.

# Activity:
# Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but skips any number divisible (x % y == 0) by 3:







# Challenge:
# Write a nested loop to print a multiplication table (1-10):







# Loop Control with Else
# In Python, you can also have an `else` block with loops. The `else` part is executed when the loop finishes normally (not stopped by `break`).

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished normally.")

# Thought Experiment:
# What do you think will happen if you add a `break` statement inside the loop?







# Infinite Loops
# Be cautious of infinite loops! They can crash your program if not handled correctly.

while True:
    print("This will run forever unless you stop it.")
    break  # comment this line to cause an infinite loop

# Safety Tip:
# Always make sure there's a way out of your loop.







# Summary and Practice
# We've covered the basics of `for` loops, `while` loops, `break` and `continue` statements, nested loops, loop control with `else`, and the dangers of infinite loops.

# Final Exercise:
# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
# For multiples of five, print "Buzz".
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz":

# And that's it for loops! Keep practicing, and you'll master loops in no time.

# Happy coding!
