# Welcome to take two of trying to teach you coding!

# I'm starting with some of the most basic functions of python.
# We already went over this, but you definitely need some refreshing.

# Firstly, I will show you what is probably the most basic thing you can do in python,
# which is to print something. All this achieves is displaying "things" in the console so you can
# see your code in action!

# How you write a print statement is as follows:

print()

# If you want to print text, for example, you would include a pair of quotation marks inside
# the parentheses like this:

print("text goes here")

# Now just for you to get the feel of doing something yourself, in the next line, I want you to
# write your own print statement:
