# Next up is variables.

# Variables are just a way of storing data.

# To compare this to a non-coding topic, let's take a math problem.

# If you were given the math problem "x + 9 = 10, Solve for x," of course, you are not
# actually computing a math problem with "X"; x is just a stand-in for the number 1.

# This is the same as in coding, where you can assign the value "1" to the variable "x".

# There are, however, many types of variables in python and programming in general, and we will
# go over some of the most common ones now.

# Firstly, there are two types of variables for numbers. Essentially all numbers have to be either
# an Integer (int) or a floating point (float).

# Int: an integer is any "whole" number. Ex. 5, 10, 500, 1, 67...

# Float: a floating point number is any non-whole number. Ex. 50.7, 1.01, 9.21354653421...

# Besides numbers, you can also assign simple text to a variable, which would be known as a string (str).

# More realistically, a string is any combination of hexadecimal digits, not necessarily exclusively text.
# What I mean by this is while a string can be "Canada", "Canada1776" can also be a string.

# While I will not go into depth about them right now, there is also a type of variable called a boolean,
# which is simply a True or False value.

# Let's see some examples to reinforce these concepts:

# Integer example
age = 25
print(age)  # Output: Age: 25

# Float example
pi = 3.14159
print(pi)  # Output: Value of pi: 3.14159

# String example
greeting = "Hello, world!"
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, world!

# Boolean example
is_student = True
print(is_student)  # Output: Is student: True
